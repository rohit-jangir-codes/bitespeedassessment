# BiteSpeed Identity Reconciliation - Backend Assignment

This is my submission for the BiteSpeed backend assignment. It implements an identity reconciliation API that consolidates contact information based on shared email addresses or phone numbers.

I am not an expert in ReactJS or TypeScript â€” I built this project with the help of an AI tool (ChatGPT), and through that process, I learned a lot about backend development and data handling using Prisma, Express, and TypeScript.
